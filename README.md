# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Classifier
**"Breast Cancer Wisconsin Classifier"** 
> is a python-based machine learning model designed to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. The model is trained using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which is freely available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29). The data input for the model includes 10 features:

1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
1Ã . Mitoses: 1 - 10

This repository contains the complete code and resources needed to train the model and make predictions on new data. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced python developer with an interest in machine learning, this repository provides a valuable learning opportunity to work with real-world medical data and develop a solution that could make a difference in people's lives.
