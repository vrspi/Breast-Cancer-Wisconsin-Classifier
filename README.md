# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Classifier
"Breast Cancer Wisconsin Classifier" is a python-based machine learning model designed to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. The model is trained using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which is freely available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data input for the model includes 10 features:

Sample code number: id number
Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
Mitoses: 1 - 10
This repository contains the complete code and resources needed to train the model and make predictions on new data. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced python developer with an interest in machine learning, this repository provides a valuable learning opportunity to work with real-world medical data and develop a solution that could make a difference in people's lives.
